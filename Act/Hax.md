# Math
## Solving Equations
### Linear Algebra
___Isolate Variables___
use inverse operations:
$mult <-> div$
$add <-> sub$


___solving "in terms of"___
A _Variable_ will be a part of the final expression
_e.g._ x in terms of y:

$$x = 2y-3$$


___Word Problems___
1) Label _Variables_
2) ID what to solve
3) Translate words into algebra, one step at a time 

## Linear Graphs
Slope = $$\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$$
Midpoint = $$(\frac{x_1+x_2}{2} ,\frac{y_1+y_2}{2})$$

# English
## Da Rules Of Nature
### colon
any time you can use a period you can use a semicolon or colon
### subject-verb
Subjects and verbs must __AGREE__ with one another in terms of __NUMBER__
### Fanboys
-	For
-	And
-	Nor
-	But
-	Or 
-	Yet
-	So

When using one of these conjunctions the _first_ part of the sentence should __explain__ the _second_
## Sentence Structure
#### Fragment
An _incomplete_ sentence missing a 
- subject
- verb 
- and or complete thought

#### Run on
Independent clauses that are incorrectly combined.

Correctly separate independent
clauses with:
1)	A period
2)	A semicolon or colon 
3)	_can_ use a comma _but_ requires conjunction _or_ by making one of the clauses dependent _i.e_ __Because, Since, While__


## Commas, Dashes, & Colons
### Commas and Dashes
Are used to sperate nonesssential information from the rest of the sentence

Is a phrase Essential?
	Try removing the phrase
	- if still correct, the phrase is nonessential.
	- if Incorrect, the phrase is essential.

_i.e_ 
	information you can remove and still have a complete sentence
	
### Colons
used to signal new information after a complete throught.
Anything before the colon has to be a complete sentence
Anything after the colon __DOES NOT__ have to be a complete sentence
