# Sentence structure
A correct sentence must contain
1) Subject
2) Verb 
3) Complete Thought

Incoorect sentence types:
1) Sentence Fragment 
	-  misggin on of the 3 parts
2) Run on sentence 
	-  two or more complete clauses, incorrectly combined
	
	
## Fragments
![[Hax#Sentence Structure#Fragment]]
_ex_

The man who revolutionized the sho industry by inventing an automatic shoe lasting machine was Jan Ernst Matzliger, a mechanic. _Born_ in 1852 of Dutch and African parents.  Matzeliger was ten years old when he began working in the machine shope that his father supervised. There, Matzeliger developed his interest in machines.

1)  No change
2) Having been born
 __3) He was born__
4) Since he was born

_No Subject_ in the sentence
there for it can not be answer choice 1 (a) or 2 (b)
the anwser is not 4 since there is not comparison made like the word "since" would indicate, making choice 4 an incomplete thought

## Run-on


_ex_

The sloth moves very slowly algae grows on its fur.

independent clauses
1)	The sloth moves very slowly 
2)	algae grows on its fur


![[Hax#Sentence Structure#Run on]]


__Not Fix__
___Can Not___ use a comma by itself to combine two independent clauses

_ex 2_
A garbage dump mat not be a pretty _place_ let's not forget who made it what it is

1) NO CHANGE
__2) place, but__
3) place but,
4) place, and

_Two Independent Clauses_ 
-	needs to be either combined or split, making option 1 incorrect.
- Comma before the conjunction, therefore it cant be option 3
- _first_ must explain the _second_ leaving option 2 ( also look for context in passage )



## Practice
### _Question 1_
During __Q1__ _performances, which_ Cambodian classical dancers use simple but meaningful stylized movements.
- NO CHANGE
-  __performances, __
-  performances that
- preformances, and

__expl__
The sentence is an independent and dependent clause, all that is required is a comma
__Takeaway:__ A sentence must contain a subject and a main verb and convey a complete idea.

### _Question 2_
They disguised their training as dances called sinulogs, which translates as “moving like a river,” __Q2__ _those_ mimicked the circular arm and leg movements of kali.

- NO CHANGE
- __That__
-  These
-  This

__expl__
sentence is two independent clauses
- option 1 is incorrect since a conjunction would be needed
- option 3 and 4 are both object pronouns and do not make the either one of the clauses dependent
- leaving only option 2

__Takeaway:__  A run-on can be corrected by changing one clause so it is no longer independent.

### _Question 3_

In the late 1960s, New York City officials made plans to build an __Q3__ _expressway, that_ would cut through Greenwich Village, Jacobs’s neighborhood.

- NO CHANGE
- expressway, it
- __expressway that__ 
- expressway; being it that

__expl__
there is a fragmentation problem not a run on one
"that would cut through Greenwich Willage"
does not a proper subject, leaving the clause with no punctuation makes it a 
it independent there by a complete sentence 

__Takeaway:__  “That” is never preceded by a comma.

## Independent Practice
### _Question 1_
Typically, a student grasps an arm-length stick made of __Q1__ _rattan, and he_ or she trains by striking the stick against an opponent’s stick.

Which of the following alternatives to the underlined portion would NOT be acceptable?
- rattan; then he */*
- __rattan, whom he__
- rattan. He
- rattan; he

__expl__
_"whom"_ must refer to a person, but "rattan" is a substance; thus, this alternative is NOT acceptable and is the correct answer

__Takeaway:__ Two independent clauses should be separated using a comma (and a FANBOYS conjunction), a semicolon, or a period.
###  _Question 2_

The man who revolutionized the shoe industry by inventing an automatic shoe-lasting machine was Jan Ernst Matzeliger, a mechanic. __Q2__ _Born_ in 1852 of Dutch and African parents. Matzeliger was ten years old when he began working in the machine shop that his father supervised. There, Matzeliger developed his interest in machines.

- NO CHANGE
- Having been born
- He was born */*
- Since was born


__expl__
includes the subject "He" and uses the past tense verb "was," forming a complete sentence

__Takeaway:__ A complete sentence requires a subject and a predicate verb to form an independent clause.
### _Question 3_
Doctors have used VR to render 3-D images of their patients’ __Q3__ _bodies; one_ day, surgeons may be able to experience what it feels like to perform delicate operations before ever picking up a scalpel.

Which of the following alternatives to the underlined portion would _NOT_ be acceptable?

- bodies;indeed, one
- bodies, and one
- bodies. One
- bodies, one */*

__expl__
two independent clauses cannot be separated by a comma without also using an appropriate conjunction word such as "and." Again, this is the correct answer because it is the only choice that is NOT grammatically acceptable

__Takeaway:__ Two independent clauses can be separated using a period, a semicolon, or a comma with a FANBOYS conjunction.

### _Question 4_
Humans likewise are impressed by the spectacular __Q4__ _colors,_ the feathers are widely valued as decorations. In 2003, physicist Jian Zi from Fudan University in Shanghai, China, led the first research group to identify the source of this vibrant color.

- NO CHANGE
- colors, but instead,
- colors if, after all,
- colors, and, as a result */*
__expl__
Correct: uses a comma and the FANBOYS conjunction "and" to  properly separate the two independent clauses; "and," combined with "as a result," captures the logical relationship by indicating that the first clause is a reason that helps explain why the second clause is true

__Takeaway:__ Two independent clauses must be separated by a period, a colon, or a comma and a FANBOYS conjunction that conveys the logical relationship between the two clauses
### _Question 5_

A spacious cavern lies before me at the bottom of the stairs. I explore lighted paths, reading signs along the way that tell about the formation of the cave. A great half-cylindrical limestone reef __Q5__ _that formed_ 250 million years ago in the inland sea that once covered the region; after the sea dried up, gypsum and salt deposits buried the reef. A few million years ago, erosion and the geologic upheaval that created the surrounding mountains exposed the reef again.

- NO CHANGE *?*
- that was formed
- __formed__
- DELETE

__expl__

Since a semicolon separates two independent clauses, the clause containing the underlined portion must be independent. But as written, the phrase containing the underlined part is a fragment that does not express a complete thought: "a limestone reef that formed 250 years ago. . ." did what? The problem is that the verb "formed" is part of a dependent phrase beginning with "that." The correct answer must remove "that" to allow the subject to have a verb.

removes _"that"_ to provide the subject ("A great half-cylindrical limestone reef") with a verb ("formed"), creating a complete sentence



# Commas, Dashes, & Colons
## Commas And Dashes
![[Hax#Commas and Dashes]]

_ex 1_
The Segway, invented by Dean Kamen, was heralded as
revolutionary at the time of its debut.

given the rules of commas and dashes the sentence can also be rewritten to

revolutionary at the time of its debut.

_ex 2_

Description of the subject in this case father is nonessential there for it needs to be marked out of the sentence
## Colons
![[Hax#Colons]]

_ex_

Delving into old garbage, has revealed important details about extinct societies.

- NO CHANGE
- garbage have
- __garbage has__
- garbage: has

__expl__ 

a colon can not be used here since the clause proceeding it is not independent

we are left with _has_ and _have_ to figure out the answer we have to find _subject-verb_ agreement
	![[Hax#subject-verb]]	
	___Note___ The _ing_ forms of a verb can stand in as a subject in this case it does
	in this sentence _delving_ is actually the subject with that mind we need a singular verb _has_
	both parts of the sentence is required to make it complete therefore no comma


## Practice
### _Question 1_
