### solving Equations




__word problem__
This spring, Malik purchased 3 trays of pepper plants and 5 trays of tomato plants for $26. If each tray of tomato plant costs twice as much as each trya of pepepper plants, how much did he pay for all the tomato plants

$t =2p$ __could also write this as__ $\frac{t}{2} = p$
$26 = 5t+3p$ __therefore__ $26 = 5t + \frac{3t}{2}$ but that would give a fraction that no one likes

$26 = 10p+3p$
$2 = p$
$t = 4$
Malik purchased $20 of tomato

__Section Notes__ 

___Isolate Variables___
use inverse operations:
$mult <-> div$
$add <-> sub$


___solving "in terms of"___
A _Variable_ will be a part of the final expression
_e.g._ x in terms of y:

$$x = 2y-3$$


___Word Problems___
1) Label _Variables_
2) ID what to solve
3) Translate words into algebra, one step at a time 


#### practice

_Question 1_
$4y= 3x-1 , x=?$
$4y + 1 =3x$
$$\frac{4y + 1}{3} = x$$

_Question 2_
$C = 0.5s + 0.35n + 0.25t$
$C = 3.55$
$n = 3$
$t =2$
$3.55 = 0.5s + 0.35(3) + 0.25(2)$

$s = 4$
_Questions 3_

$r = 30 +g$
$g = 21 + b$
$105 = r + g + b$
$105 = (30 + 21+ b) + (21 + b) + b$

$105 = 72 + 3b$

$b = 11$

$r = 30 + (21 + 11)$
$$r = 62$$
