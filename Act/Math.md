## Solving Equations
__word problem__
This spring, Malik purchased 3 trays of pepper plants and 5 trays of tomato plants for $26. If each tray of tomato plant costs twice as much as each trya of pepepper plants, how much did he pay for all the tomato plants

$t =2p$ __could also write this as__ $\frac{t}{2} = p$
$26 = 5t+3p$ __therefore__ $26 = 5t + \frac{3t}{2}$ but that would give a fraction that no one likes

$26 = 10p+3p$
$2 = p$
$t = 4$
Malik purchased $20 of tomato

### Practice

#### _Question 1_
$4y= 3x-1 , x=?$
$4y + 1 =3x \rightarrow x=\frac{4y + 1}{3}$

#### _Question 2_
$C = 0.5s + 0.35n + 0.25t , C=3.44 , n=3, t=2$
$3.55 = 0.5s + 0.35(3) + 0.25(2) \rightarrow s = 4$
#### _Questions 3_
$r = 30 + g , g= 21 + b$
$105 = r + g + b \rightarrow 105 = (30 + 21+ b) + (21 + b) + b$

$105 = 72 + 3b \rightarrow b = 11$

$r = 30 + (21 + 11) \rightarrow r = 62$

 ### indpendant practice 
 
 #### _Question 1_
 $3y + \frac{2}{3}= 5y , y=?$
 
 $9y + 2 = 15y  \rightarrow 2= 6y \rightarrow y =\frac{1}{3}$
 
 #### _Question 2_
 
 $B = 7LH, B = 280, L = 16$
 
 $280  = 7(16)H \rightarrow H = 2.5$
 
#### _Question 3_
$y = cx \rightarrow 56 = 10c$
$\frac{56}{10} =c$


#### _Question 4_

$8(15 + 12)$

#### _Question 5_

$l = 2m \rightarrow 2s = m$
$m + 2m + \frac{m}{2}$
