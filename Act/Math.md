### Solving Equations
__word problem__
This spring, Malik purchased 3 trays of pepper plants and 5 trays of tomato plants for $26. If each tray of tomato plant costs twice as much as each trya of pepepper plants, how much did he pay for all the tomato plants

$t =2p$ __could also write this as__ $\frac{t}{2} = p$
$26 = 5t+3p$ __therefore__ $26 = 5t + \frac{3t}{2}$ but that would give a fraction that no one likes

$26 = 10p+3p$
$2 = p$
$t = 4$
Malik purchased $20 of tomato

#### practice

_Question 1_
$4y= 3x-1 , x=?$
$4y + 1 =3x$
$x = \frac{4y + 1}{3}$

_Question 2_
$C = 0.5s + 0.35n + 0.25t$
$C = 3.55$
$n = 3$
$t =2$
$3.55 = 0.5s + 0.35(3) + 0.25(2)$

$s = 4$
_Questions 3_

$r = 30 +g$
$g = 21 + b$
$105 = r + g + b$
$105 = (30 + 21+ b) + (21 + b) + b$

$105 = 72 + 3b$

$b = 11$

$r = 30 + (21 + 11)$
$r = 62$

 #### indpendant practice 
 
 _Question 1_
 $3y + \frac{2}{3}= 5y$ solve for y
 
 $9y + 2 = 15y$
 $2 = 6y$
 $y = \frac{1}{3}$
 
 _Question 2_
 
 $B = 7LH$
 $B = 280$
 $L = 16$
 
 $280  = 7(16)H$
 
 $H = 2.5$
 
 _Question 3_
 
 
$y = cx$
$56 = 10c$
$\frac{56}{10} =c$


_Question 4_

$8(15 + 12)$

_Question 5_

$l = 2m$
$2s = m$

$m + 2m + \frac{m}{2}$
