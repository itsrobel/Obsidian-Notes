$$M = \frac{n}{v}$$
 where 
 m is molarity/concentration
 n is moles
 v is volume
 
 
 0.5 grams of NaCl is dissolved to make 0.75L of solution.
 solve for concentration
 

$$\frac{0.5g NaCl}{}  \frac{1m NaCl}{58g NaCl}$$

$$ M = \frac{0.009m NaCl}{0.75L} $$

$M = 0.012$

0.5g sodium Chloride is dissolved to make
0.075mL of solution. solve for concentration?

$$ M = \frac{0.009M}{0.000075L} $$

$M = 120m$

$Ca(OH)_2 + 2HCL => CaCl_2 + 2H_20$

How many liters of $0.100m$ $HCl$ would it take to completely react with 5g $Ca(0H)_2$

$$\frac{5g Ca(HO)_2}{}$$
